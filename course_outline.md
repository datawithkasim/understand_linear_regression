- **Creating a Simple Web Interface for Your Model**
- **Monitoring Model Performance**
- **Updating and Maintaining Your Deployed Model**

## Capstone Project
Throughout the course, students will work on a capstone project that ties together all the concepts learned. The project will involve:

- Selecting a real-world dataset
- Performing exploratory data analysis
- Building and evaluating a linear regression model
- Deploying the model
- Creating a report and presentation of findings
- Peer review and feedback session

This project will be developed incrementally as students progress through the modules, with dedicated time in each module to apply new concepts to the project.
